module Tk

    module_function

    # Creates an image and a commend of the same name.
    # Returns the name of the command containing the image.
    #
    # +type+ specifies the type of the image, which must be one of the types
    # currently defined (e.g., bitmap or photo).
    #
    # +name+ specifies the name for the image; if it is ommitted then Tk picks a
    # name of the form imagex, where x is an integer.
    #
    # +options+ may be a Hash containing configuration options for the new
    # image.
    #
    # The legal set of +options+ is defined separately for each image type; see
    # documentation of [Image] for built-in image types.
    #
    # If a proc already exists with the given name, then it is replaced with
    # the new image and any instances of that image will redisplay with the new
    # contents.
    # It is important to note that [create] will silently overwrite any existing
    # images of the same name, so choose the name wisely.
    #
    # It is recommended to use a separate namespace for image names, like
    # "::img::logo" or "::img::large"

    # be dropped.
    # Existing instances will retain their sizes but redisplay as empty areas.
